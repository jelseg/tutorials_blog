Includes create page,route, database, CRUD

create application:
in terminal, in folder:
rails new ''name''
check by:
cd ''name''
rails server


create controller to make a page
rails generate controller ''name''

created a page:
in config/routes
''method'' ''name'', to ''controller''#''name''
eg
get 'about', to: 'pages#about'
in controller ad:
def ''name''
end
in folder in views add ''name''.html.erb file


create CRUDs
rails generate scaffold ''name'' ''fiel1dname'':''field1type'' ''other fields''
eg 
rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:text
check created routes:
rails routes --expanded
migrate the new migration files:
rails db:migrate

alternative:
create migration file:
rails generate migration name_of_migration_file
fill in this migration file
and routes, controllers and pages

for routes you can use
resources :''name'', only: [:''methodnames'']
eg
resources :articles, only: [:show, :index, :new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy]
ps above statement is equivalent to "resources :articles" since all rest methods are added


-------------

set validations for fields
in model add (app/models/<name>.rb) add
validates :<field name>, <validations>

eg
validates :title, presence: true, length: {minimum: 6, maximum: 50}
